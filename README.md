The project titled "82 MW Bagasse-Based Renewable Energy Project at DSPL, Pune " is a
bagasse-based co-generation (co-gen) power project successfully commissioned by
Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL).

 The 18 MW co-generation plant was commissioned on December 27, 2009.

 Another 64 MW (32mw*2) co-generation plant was synchronized on October 20, 2023, and
started exporting power on October 20, 2023. From November 2023, the total capacity of the
project proponent's turbine is 82 MW.

During the absence of biomass, coal is used to generate electricity. The amount of fossil fuels
co-fired does not exceed 80% of the total fuel fired on an energy basis according to ACM0006-
CDM methodology booklet of UNFCCC. Hence the project is eligible for UCR CoUs

Gross Power Generation Capacity (18+64= 82 MW)

 This represents the total installed power generation capacity of the sugar mill, which is 82
megawatts (MW). This power is generated mainly using bagasse, a by-product of the
sugarcane milling process.

 Season: The mill has the capability to generate 82 MW of power during the sugarcane
crushing season.

 Off-Season: The power generation capacity is reduced to approximate 32 MW during the
off-season. This reduction is likely because the mill and associated operations consume less
energy during this period, and fewer resources like bagasse are used for power generation.

2. Power Consumption (For Sugar Mill Cane Crushing & Boiler Auxiliary)
 Season: During the sugarcane crushing season, the mill consumes 8.10 MW of power for
operations like cane crushing and for auxiliary systems related to the boiler.

 Off-Season: During the off-season, only 2.00 MW is consumed, as the sugar mill is not in full
operation, and energy consumption is significantly lower.

 Season: During the active sugarcane crushing season, the mill consumes 17.96 MW for its
operations, which include the cane crushing process and running the boiler’s auxiliary
systems.

 Off-Season: Power consumption drops significantly to 2.40 MW because cane crushing is
not happening, and only essential equipment or maintenance activities are running.

4. Power Consumption (For Distilleries)
   
 The distilleries consume a small amount of power, approximately 4 MWh in both seasons.

6. Total Auxiliary Consumption
 This is the total power consumed by the mill's internal operations (for the mill, boiler
auxiliary, distilleries, and colonies):

o Season: 8.13 MW

o Off-Season: 2.03 MW

o Season: The total power consumption during the season is 17.96 MW (entirely used
for the mill’s operations).

o Off-Season: The total power consumption during the off-season is much lower at
2.40 MW.

5. Exportable Power at Interconnection Point (Aggregate Exportable Contracted Capacity)

 After meeting internal consumption needs, the excess power is available for export to the
grid:

o Season: The exportable power during the season is 9.87 MW.

o Off-Season: In the off-season, since internal consumption is lower, the exportable
power increases to 15.97 MW.

 After the mill's internal consumption is met, the remaining power is exported to the grid:

o Season: During the sugarcane season, 46.04 MW of power is exportable to the grid.

o Off-Season: Since internal consumption is low, the exportable power increases to
29.60 MW during the off-season.

The sugar industry in the state is contributing more than 40% of sugar production of the
country. Pune district is treated as traditional cane growing area and increased sugarcane area
in pune district motivated shri Gajanan vishwanath patkar a well-known industrialist and noted
chartered accountant has decided to set up a sugar mill of 3500 TCD at alegaon (kadam wasti),
tal Daund, dist: Pune with the active support of cane growers of daund tahasil.
Daund tahasil, due to surplus sugarcane production, is facing problem of disposal of cane, can
give required cane to propose sugar mill. Similarly the farmers are willing to contribute and
raise required promoters equity for setting up sugar mill.
Accordingly shri Gajanan vishwanath patkar has submitted IEM to the department of industries,
Govt. of India and has obtained ack no 2538/SIA/IMO/2008 Dated 07/08/2008 for setting up
3500 TCD sugar mill. The company is also registered with the registrar of companies,
Maharashtra under the name and style of daund sugar ltd. bearing registration no U 15421 PN
2007 PTC 130272 dated 07/06/2007. The management has also decided to erect cogeneration
18 MW and 45 KLPD ethanol plant at sugar factory, for which company has obtained IEM No.
3247/SIA/IMO/2008 dated 7th October 2008 and IEM No. 3246/SIA/IMO/2008 dated 7th
October 2008 respectively. Further name changes to daund sugar private limited.
